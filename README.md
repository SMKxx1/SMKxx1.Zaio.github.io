## Steps for cloning the Webpage
⚠️ Turns out people at Zaio are constantly updating the website and thus these files may have different names.

1. Go to [Zaio Webpage](https://zaio.io/), right-click and select **"Save as..."** to save the file in your desired folder (alternatively you can also press ***CTRL+S***).

3. This folder will contain all the images and Javascript files required by the webpage. However the js files will have .download at the end of their name. In order to fix that right-click in the folder and select ***View > Details*** after which you can click on type and sort the files.

4. Search for the files with the type listed as **"DOWNLOAD File"**, right-click on the file and select rename.
